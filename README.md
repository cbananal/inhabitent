###Tools and Languages Used
* HTML5 / CSS3
* Flexbox
* SASS
* BEM Method
* Javascript / jQuery
* Wordpress / PHP
* MAMP / Gulp

###The Experience / Learning Outcomes
I have tried dabbling with Wordpress once before this project but I can say that it is with this one that I have truly learned the said CMS in-depth and how to properly use it and its features.

Working with a starter theme involved a lot of styling and that was both a fun and challenging experience, especially since it's a multi-page site unlike our other projects in class. It was a great opportunity to practice the important skill of reading code by other developers and to write less code as much as possible. In line with this, I really tried to practice SASS and the BEM naming convention in the process.

I enjoy and appreciate Wordpress and PHP and I want to use it more for future projects. I want and am committed to continuously learn and be better at it.
