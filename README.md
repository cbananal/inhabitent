##Experience / Learning Outcomes
I have tried dabbling with Wordpress once before this project but I can say that it is only now that I have truly learned it in-depth and discovered how powerful it is.

Working with a starter theme involved a lot of styling, and that was both a fun and challenging experience, especially since it's a multi-page site unlike our other projects in class. It was a great opportunity to practice the important skill of reading code by other developers, and to write less code as much as possible. With this, I really tried to practice SASS in the process.

I enjoy and appreciate Wordpress and PHP and I want to use it more for future projects. I want and am committed to continuously learn and be better at it.
